Spherical K-Means and expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithms were developed and tested on two datasets. The EM algorithm can fit a finite mixture of von Mises-Fishers unsupervisedly. The vMF distribution was used as it allows for better modelling of datasets with 
very large dimensions, as directional vectors on a hypersphere rather than points in a Euclidean space. 

`dataset 1`:  a small-scale dataset with 4-dimensional features; the dataset has no labels
provided

`dataset 2`: a large-scale dataset with 3000-dimensional features; correct labels (the last
column) are given to measure the clustering performance.
